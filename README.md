# Explain purpose of project
- Beat Maker: Allows users to create their own musical beats directly in the browser, using an interactive grid-based interface.
- Playlist Generator: Helps users discover music tailored to their moods. You describe how you're feeling, and the app suggests curated playlists (using Spotify).
- Video Editor: Provides basic video editing capabilities directly in the browser. Users can upload videos and perform actions like:
- - Format Conversion: Change video file formats (to MP4).
- - Codec Selection: Choose video codecs for compression and compatibility.
- - Cropping: Cut out sections of the video frame.
- - Trimming: Shorten the video by setting start and end times.
- - Resolution Adjustment: Change the video dimensions.
- - Frame Rate (FPS) Control: Adjust the video's frames per second.
- Song Maker (Collaborative): Offers a unique, collaborative song creation experience. Users can join a queue, and when it's their turn, they contribute a word. The app then combines these words in some way, possibly to generate lyrics or a song title. Also has an ai summary.
- Fanwall: Posts fans can make. Will be saved across devices.
- Quote Generator: AI generates quotes to help bring up your mood.

# Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them
One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating all the different functionalities seamlessly. We had the song maker, video editor, playlist generator, and fan wall, and getting them to work together without conflicts proved tricky. We also struggled a bit with responsive design, particularly making sure the layout looked. Finally, we underestimated the time it would take to polish the UI and synchronize the devices with songmaker on the backend.
